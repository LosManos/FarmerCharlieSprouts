#TODO
Check if we can return a value from the console. The Main method is void; can it be int?

Handle if file does not exist.

Move this todo to Github.

Make line count count a bit more clever than just \n.

Make line count return something more correct;  
1) it reports lines *before* the new text so new text starting with newline *feel* having the wrong line number.  
2) it seems to lag one change, sometimes the new row shows one change later.

#Done
Make file name as parameter to console program, not hard coded dev value as today.
